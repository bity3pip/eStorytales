All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys: his horrible aunt and uncle and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny Cupboard Under the Stairs, he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years, and his birthday present is his uncle's old socks.\r\nBut all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.",

But just as he is packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.\r\n\r\nAnd strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girl's bathroom. But then the real trouble begins - something is attacking Hogwarts students, making them rigid like statues. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past reveals dark secrets? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects ... Harry Potter himself!",

It's assumed that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry to be.
